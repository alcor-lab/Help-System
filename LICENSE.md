      suitable agreements with you containing applicable terms and conditions
      consistent with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and
      provided further that you shall be liable to Ocado for any breach by
      your suppliers or independent contractors of this Agreement to the same
      extent as you would be if you had breached the Agreement yourself.

   c. No Other Licence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, nothing in
      this Agreement shall be construed as a licence to any intellectual
      property rights of Ocado other than those rights embodied in the
      Licenced Materials provided to you by Ocado. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED HEREIN,

      other than your employees and contractors whose job performance requires

      Software or with software developed using Open Source Software tools in
      connection with the Project provided you do not incorporate, combine or
      distribute the Licenced Materials, and any Derivative Works thereof, in
      a manner that subjects the Licenced Materials, and any Derivative Works
      thereof, to any licence obligations or any other intellectual property
      related terms of any licence governing such Open Source Software. You
      understand and acknowledge that such Open Source Software is not

   occurs first), you will destroy any and all copies of the Licenced
   Materials, and any Derivative Works thereof, in your possession, custody or
   control and provide to Ocado a written statement signed by your authorized

   Agreement which existed at or before the date of termination or expiry.

4. Licenced Materials Ownership and Derivative Works

   a. The Licenced Materials are licenced, not sold to you, and can only be
      used in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and for the sole
      purpose of the Project. Subject to the licences granted to you pursuant
      to this Agreement, Ocado and its Affiliates own and shall continue to
      own all right, title, and interest in and to the Licenced Materials,
      including all copies thereof as well as any updates or upgrades to the
      Licenced Materials and all Derivative Works thereof, whether conceived
      of or created by you or Ocado. The parties further agree that all
      Derivative Works conceived of or made by Ocado that are based, either in
      whole or in part, on your feedback, suggestions or recommendations are
      the exclusive property of Ocado and all right, title and interest in and
      to such Derivative Works will vest solely in Ocado.

   b. All intellectual property rights in the Derivative Works conceived of or
      created by you shall pass to Ocado upon creation of those intellectual
      property rights and you agree to assign, and hereby assign, to Ocado
      absolutely with full title guarantee all such intellectual property
      rights at no additional cost to Ocado. You shall on request promptly
      perform (or procure the performance of) all further acts and things, and
      execute and deliver (or procure the execution or delivery of including
      without limit from all your suppliers and contractors) all further
      documents, required by law or which Ocado requests, to vest in Ocado the
      full benefit of the right, title and interest in the Derivative Works
      assigned to Ocado under this clause 4.

   c. Without prejudice to the foregoing, if you are an individual and your
      employer has rights to intellectual property that you create in your
      contributions to the Derivative Works, you represent and warrant that
      you have received permission to make such contributions on behalf of
      that employer and that your employer has waived such rights for your
      contributions to Ocado. Further, you irrevocably waive any rights you
      may have under Chapter IV (Moral Rights) Part 1 of the Copyright Design
      and Patents Act 1988 in relation to the Derivative Works conceived of or
      created by you.

   d. You agree that all of your contributions to the Derivative Works shall

      communication sent by you to Ocado or its representatives, including but
      not limited to the relevant Project shared repositories that are managed
      by, or on behalf of, Ocado for the purposes of the Project.

5. Intellectual Property Rights

   a. The Licenced Materials contain copyrighted material, trade secrets and
      other proprietary information of Ocado and its Affiliates which are
      protected by copyright laws, international copyright treaties, and trade
      secret laws, as well as other applicable intellectual property laws. To
      protect Ocado’s and its Affiliates rights in the Licenced Materials, you
      agree, except as otherwise permitted by law, not to “unlock”, decompile,
      reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise translate to a human
      perceivable form any portions of the Licenced Materials provided to you
      in object code format only, nor permit any person or entity to do so.
      You shall not remove, alter, cover, or obscure any confidentiality,
      trade secret, trade mark, patent, copyright or other proprietary notice
      or other identifying marks or designs from any component of the Licenced
      Materials and you shall reproduce and include in all copies of the
      Licenced Materials, and any Derivative Works thereof, the copyright
      notice(s) and proprietary legend(s) of Ocado and its Affiliates as they
      appear in the Licenced Materials. Ocado reserves all rights not
      specifically granted under this Agreement.

   b. Certain Licenced Materials may be based on industry recognized standards
      or software programs published by industry recognized standards bodies
      and certain third parties may claim to own patents, copyrights, and
      other intellectual property rights that cover implementation of those
      standards. You acknowledge and agree that this Agreement does not convey
      a licence to any such third party patents, copyrights, and other
      intellectual property rights in such standards. Moreover, you
      acknowledge that you are responsible for any fees or royalties that may
      be payable to any third party based on such third party’s interests in
      the Licenced Materials or any intellectual property rights that cover
      implementation of any industry recognized standard, any software program
      published by any industry recognized standards bodies or any other
      proprietary technology.

   c. Moreover, you acknowledge and agree that when your independently
      developed software or hardware components are combined, in whole or in
      part, with the Licenced Materials, your right to use the combined work
      that includes the Licenced Materials remains subject to the terms and
      conditions of this Agreement.

6. Audit Right

   At Ocado’s request, and within thirty (30) days after receiving written
   notice, you shall permit an independent auditor selected by Ocado to have
   access, no more than twice each calendar year (unless the immediately
   preceding audit revealed a discrepancy) and during your regular business
   hours, to all of your equipment, records, and documents as may contain
   information bearing upon the use of the Licenced Materials and any
   Derivative Works thereof.

7. Confidential Information

   You acknowledge and agree that the Licenced Materials contain trade secrets
   and other confidential information of Ocado and its Affiliates. You agree
   to use the Licenced Materials and any Derivative Works thereof, solely
   within the scope of the licences set forth herein, to maintain the Licenced
   Materials and any Derivative Works thereof, in strict confidence, to use at
   least the same procedures and degree of care that you use to prevent
   disclosure of your own confidential information of like importance but in
   no instance less than reasonable care, and to prevent disclosure of the
   Licenced Materials and any Derivative Works thereof, to any third party,
   unless you have obtained our prior written consent. You agree to inform
   your employees and contractors of the confidential nature of the Licenced
   Materials and any Derivative Works and to obtain executed confidentiality
   agreements with your employees and contractors having access to the
   Licenced Materials and any Derivative Works thereof, and to diligently take
   steps to enforce such agreements in this respect.
